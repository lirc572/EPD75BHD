# EPD75BHD Examples

- To try these examples on the Arduino IDE, just directly open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE
- To try any of these examples on PlatformIO IDE:
  - Copy the example's source files to your PlatformIO project's `/src` folder
  - Locate the `.ino` file
    - Change the file's extension from `.ino` to `.cpp`
    - Add `#include <Arduino.h>` to the top of the file
    - Make sure all functions are decalred before being used (all examples of this library already done so)
